The project has been coded in kotlin, so you should install the kotlin plugin (only if your android studio version is lower than 3.0) to run it.

### 1. Install Kotlin plugin
The following [kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html) explains how to install it :

*The Kotlin plugin is bundled with Android Studio starting from version 3.0. If you use an earlier version, you'll need to install the Kotlin plugin. Go to File | Settings | Plugins | Install JetBrains plugin… and then search for and install Kotlin. If you are looking at the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen, choose Configure | Plugins | Install JetBrains plugin… You'll need to restart the IDE after this completes.*

### 2. Run the project
Now, you just have to launch the project on your device.
